# enar2018rrpkg

The goal of enar2018rrpkg is to collect scripts and 
templates used for project infrastructure: setting
up directory structures, adding common files, and
the like. 

## Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}

## Not run

populate_project()

## This starts in a new project (with a .Rproj file in
## the root folder) and adds commonly used folders if 
## these don't already exist. By default, it adds folders
## for R/, data/, and results/.

```
